This project allows you to create storage of your employees!

You can add, update and delete information about employees;

To run this program you have to use Tomcat. After pressing 'Run' button you would see a web-page with all existing employees;

If you press 'add' button you would be redirected to a new web-page with empty fields where you can enter information abou an employee - [name, surname, department, salary]
You can always change information by clicking on 'update' button on the main page.

After adding a new employee you would be redirected to the main web-page with list of all employees.

All employees a stored in MySQL database viahibernate.

I made this project in order to understand how to work with Spring MVC. 

You can check slides to see how it works - [link](https://github.com/Aslan2500/Employee_Storage/blob/main/Demonstration.pdf) or you can simply go the demonstration.pdf
